Need to finish index.js ---- connecitons through

use npm scripts to seed?

using through model!!!





------ check on index.js in models for fixes of listed items

------    products deletes but still shows 400 bad request


in get requests, inside findall({
    include: [{ model: yada,
    attribute: {
        exclude: [yidda],
    }}]
})

this includes the model yada, all data come through, to exclude excessive info use attributs inside that object of model and exclude what is extra.

use this ot clean up gets for exactly what is asked for
