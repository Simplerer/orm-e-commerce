  ## Description
  This application is designed to emulate the creation of an API and back-end for an e-commerce company. I used some provided basework to build out Models and routes for the data about this company's available products. Using associations, one is able to search through, update, and delete any information on the available database.
    
  ## Installation
  To begin, one must first install the dependencies. This particular application requires express, dotenv, mysql2, and sequelize. After these are installed, enter npm run db:sync, npm run seed, and npm start in this order. This will create the database neededm seed it with information , and then run the application. Open Insomnia and set the proper pathways to test. You will need a base route of /api/products, /api/categories, and /api/tags to search each respective data-field.
    
  ## Usage
  This proiject was intended to deepen my understanding of how sequelize runs a conduit between mySQL and javascript. Also this has helped me learn how to develop databases and seed them with my CLI.
